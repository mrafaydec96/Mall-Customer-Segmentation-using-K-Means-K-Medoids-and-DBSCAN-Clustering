# Mall-Customer-Segmentation-Using-Clustering
This project analyzes different customer segments that exists in the mall data using K-means, K-medoids, and DBSCAN clustering algorithms. The purpose of applying clustering algorithms on this data is to identify the different segments of customers that exist in the mall.

# Dataset Description
The dataset is about customers who visit a supermarket mall. Data recorded for the customers include variables like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score.

# Findings: What Customer Segments were identified?

**K-means proved to be the best clustering algorithm in this case with a Silhouette Score of 0.55. It outlined 5 optimal clusters in the data.**

**High Income, High Spending (Cluster 1):**

Customers in this cluster have a high annual income and also spend a significant amount. They may be considered high-value customers. Strategies for this group might include offering premium products, exclusive services, or loyalty programs to maintain their high spending.

**Moderate Income, Moderate Spending (Cluster 2):**

This cluster represents customers with a moderate annual income and spending score. They are likely to make average purchases. Strategies for this group could involve targeted promotions, discounts, or incentives to encourage slightly higher spending.

**Low Income, Low Spending (Cluster 3):**

Customers in this cluster have lower annual income and tend to spend less. Understanding this group is crucial for optimizing pricing and ensuring affordability. Consider offering budget-friendly products, discounts, or value packages to cater to their needs.

**High Income, Low Spending (Cluster 4):**

This group has a high annual income but doesn't spend as much. Understanding the reasons behind their lower spending is important. It could be due to specific preferences, lack of incentives, or other factors. Tailor marketing strategies to encourage higher spending within this affluent group.

**Low Income, High Spending (Cluster 5):**

This cluster represents customers with a lower annual income but a high spending score. Understanding the motivations behind their high spending is key. It could be related to specific product preferences, special promotions, or the influence of other factors. Create strategies to retain and encourage spending in this segment.
